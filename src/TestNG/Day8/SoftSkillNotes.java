            In the grooming meeting we are as a team talking about this story and giving points.

                story 2 --> point is 8 - 13


            When you worked on the user story are working first automation or manaul testing ?
                 First I am testing in manual so making sure functionality is working fine
              then if all test cases are working then I am working on the automation.

            You find defect in manually more or automation more?
                In manual. Because I am testing the user story in manual first this is why I am able to
             find defect in manual more as well.
